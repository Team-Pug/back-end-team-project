## Funventory Back End

Funventory is an application that allows the user to view, create and update products in an inventory system. A user can only delete products that they have created. Technologies used include Express and MongoDB.

The API expects all CRUD functions for both users and products, though the front end only implements post, patch, and delete actions for users and post, patch, get (index), and delete actions for products.
