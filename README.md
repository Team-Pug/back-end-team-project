## Inventory Management System

The Inventory Management System app functions as a single page application using HTML and CSS for styling. The [client side](https://github.com/Team-Pug/inventory-front-end) is written in Javascript with the jQuery library and Handlebars templating. The back end is written utilizing Mongoose and a MongoDB database.

## Check out the page

The back end was deployed on [Heroku](https://funventory.herokuapp.com/).

The front end GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Team-Pug/inventory-front-end).
